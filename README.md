## 📋 Requirements

This project is designed to run on **Google Colab** for easy access to powerful computing resources.  
No installation is required beyond having a Google account.  
However, the following Python libraries are used in the project:

- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Scikit-Learn**

These libraries are pre-installed in Google Colab. If running locally, you can install them using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
```
